001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(m * n)
Space complexity: O(m * n)
This is a good explanation to this solution:

002.cpp:
Time complexity: O(m * n)
Space complexity: O(n)(n is the size of string p)
003.cpp:
Time complexity: O(m * n)(the author claims this a linear solution, why?)
Space complexity: O(1)

004.cpp:
Time complexity: O(?)
Space complexity: O(?)
This solution has a TLE problem, I am not sure whether it is right.
