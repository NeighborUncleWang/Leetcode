There are two versions. 001.cpp use extra O(2n) space, one vector is used to store the result of the previous line, the other is used to store the result of current line.
Another way is use only one vector to store the result. One trick is that you should caculate the reuslt of each line from size() - 1 to 0, not 0 to size() - 1. This can avoid lose the result of previous line when calculate the result of current line.
