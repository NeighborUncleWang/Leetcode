001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(logn)(for the stack)
The recursive version.
002.cpp:
Time compelxity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)
The iterative version.
003.cpp:
I think this version is wrong, but it can still pass the OJ, maybe there is not enough test cases. Image when n == -3, n = FFFF FFFD(D = b'1101)
