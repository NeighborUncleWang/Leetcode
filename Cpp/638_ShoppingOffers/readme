001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(6^6*1)?
002.cpp:
Time complexity: O(100^36)
The time complexity is exponential. The size of this problem is given small, so it works.
Letâ€™s take the max case as an example.
You got 6 items, 100 offers and need to buy max 6 items each.
At the start point, you have 100 choices and once you pick one offer,
there is another 100 choices for the next level.
It is a decision tree with 100 branches each level in max.
The level of the tree in max is 36. (6 types of items and 6 each in max).
