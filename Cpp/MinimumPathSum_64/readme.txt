001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(mn)
Space complexity: O(n)
Only use one vector to store the intermediate result. Only store the current row's intermediate result.
002.cpp:
Time complexity: O(mn)
Space complexity: O(mn)
The straightforward version. Need O(mn) extra space to store the whole matrix of the intermediate results.
