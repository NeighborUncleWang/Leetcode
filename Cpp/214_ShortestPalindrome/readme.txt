001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(1n)
Space complexity: O(1n)
002.cpp:
Time complexity: O(2n)
Space complexity: O(2n)
Although 001.cpp and 002.cpp are both O(n) solution, the constant is different, 001.cpp is 1 while 002.cpp is 2. So the runtime is different: 4ms VS 8ms.

003.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(n)
A brutal-force solution, good to implement this solution first during interview.
