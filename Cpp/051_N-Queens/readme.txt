001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n^n)
Space complexity: O(n)
this is the standard version of DFS
002.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n^n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Another version from code ganker, avoid push_back() and pop_back(), but I don't think this is a good way.

update:
003.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n^n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Add a solution with more detailed comments.
