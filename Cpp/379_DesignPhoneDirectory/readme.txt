001.cpp:
Time complexity: 
get(): O(1)
check(): O(1)
release(): O(1)
Space complexity: O(n)
Reference:
My solution.
If the hash table is implemented in a good way(few conflicts), then it can have the same performation as 002.cpp.
002.cpp:
Time complexity: 
get(): O(1)
check(): O(1)
release(): O(1)
Space complexity: O(n)
