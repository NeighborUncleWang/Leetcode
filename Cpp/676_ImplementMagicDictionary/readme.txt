Time complexity: O(∑wi^2) to build and O(K^2) to search
Space complexity: O(∑wi^2)
002.cpp:
Time Complexity: O(S) to build and O(NK) to search, where N is the number of words in our magic dictionary,
S is the total number of letters in it, and K is the length of the search word. length of the search word.
Space Complexity: O(S), the space used by buckets
