001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n * m)(n is the size of the strs vector, m is the size of the shortest string in the strs vector)
Space complexity: O(1)
002.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n * m)
Space complexity: O(1)
The idea is the same. Just some small details vary.
003.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n * m)
Space complexity: O(1)
I wrote the version myself and this is much shorter and cleaner than the previous two version.
