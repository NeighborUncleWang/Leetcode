001.cpp time complexity is O(2n), space complexity is O(2n). We do the scan twice: from left to right and from right to left. Need two vectors to contain the intermediate result.
002.cpp has time complexity O(n), space complexity O(1). This is a better solution, harder to think. Block contains the accumulative value of height[i], sum means the whole area including the water and the black block in the graph.
