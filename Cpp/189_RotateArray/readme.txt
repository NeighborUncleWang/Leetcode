001.cpp:
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
002.cpp:
The same as 001.cpp, just uses the std::reverse instead of reverse(). The idea: https://github.com/julycoding/The-Art-Of-Programming-By-July/blob/master/ebook/zh/01.01.md
There is another efficient way(http://blog.csdn.net/lanceleng/article/details/8707168), but I cann't understand it.
